        <p>In the Global Leaders & Scholars in STEM (GLASS) program at Tandon Honors, students engage in diverse experiences, research, and exploration aligned with Tandon's Areas of Research Excellence. Their projects are designed to integrate with the NAE Grand Challenges and consider the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals. Over the course of three years in the GLASS Program, students gain a profound comprehension of their potential impact in creating positive global change. Emerging as socially responsible innovators and engineers, GLASS students are well-equipped to contribute meaningfully to the world.</p>
